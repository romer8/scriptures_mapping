What I have learned

I have learn a lot of things specially related to the construction of HTML elements using functions. I did not think that it was possible
to use inner HTML with the `` quotes to construct them. In addition, I thought it was a good practice to use a closure in the Scriptures.js package
to use the different functions inside the package, and also the organization of the different variables and constant for ordering. It was a good practice, and
it is a style that I am starting to use. Finally, the use of Ajax call without jquery was something I did not use before, and I liked because it was also simple,
and gives you more understanding about how callbacks work.

What I have accomplished

I think I have accomplished most of the required work. I have declared the function showLocation to zoom in the bounds of the markers present by using const that
convert the viewAltitude parameter to a zoom level. In addition, I have added buttons for the next and previous chapter by creating html elements that are similar to the
scriptureMapped.byu.edu site. This was accomplished by inspecting such page to look to the elements that are part of the prev and next buttons. Finally, I have provided
the previous chapter function. Another important thing was to be able to create labels that has the different places that have the same position, this was accomplished by
looking to the gmMarkers array, and looking if the getPosition() function of each marker was the same or not. Finally such elements were set to null.

Code Reference.

Most of the code is from Dr Little's code in the series of videos. The other part of the code is from
reading the documentation on google maps javascript Api, and the use of the Array.from function in HTML element
in https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-array-method/.
